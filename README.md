# FoodOrderingSystem
 This repository showcases my team's work in building a website for a food ordering system, allowing customers to choose their menu and submit orders. The project utilizes PHP as the primary technology, along with MySQL for the database. For testing purposes, you can deploy it using XAMPP or WAMP on localhost.
